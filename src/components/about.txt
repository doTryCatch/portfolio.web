Greetings! I'm Roshan Patel, a 20-year-old enthusiast from Nepal. Coding and sports are my dual passions that keep my days vibrant and dynamic. As an avid problem solver, I thrive on tackling new challenges, whether in the realm of coding or engaging in outdoor sports. Beyond the digital landscape, you can often find me immersed in the tranquility of nature, trekking through the scenic landscapes of Nepal. Drawing is my creative outlet, and I find solace in bringing my thoughts to life on paper. Music holds a special place in my heart, and I'm always on the lookout for soulful songs to accompany my journey. Join me in the adventure of life, where coding, sports, outdoor activities, drawing, and music converge to create a tapestry of experiences. Let's connect and share our passions!
